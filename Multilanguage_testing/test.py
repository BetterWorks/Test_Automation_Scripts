      "text": "In the last three quarters, we have collaborated on Slack and Teams improvements as well as the discussion on adopting NextGen engines. 1. You are good in oral communication and articulating thoughts while actively contributing to all the products and features we have developed so far. One area for improvement could be to think beyond the immediate question and consider the broader context to provide richer responses, which may require some time to adapt to. 2. Your understanding of product requirements has consistently resulted in high-quality products. It would be beneficial if you also take some time to identify non-user requirements early on if they are missing. 3. You effectively highlight challenges and complexity, yet enhancing readability of your documents for all audiences could be improved by adding more context before diving into technical details, drawing inspiration from Manish's past documents. 4. Your performance in contributing to project goals and deliverables is exemplary. Keep in mind the business impact of the features you work on, and engage with Product by asking questions during the initial stages, possibly through a brief brainstorming session. 5. Your insights on technical challenges when discussing upcoming features have been invaluable in facilitating prompt decision-making. 6. During the initial Slack implementation, I expected more proactive actions from your side. But post that for Slack V2.1 Phase 2 & MS Teams improvements & NextGen discussion, you have showcased a notable improvement in problem-solving approach over the past few months. 7. I can see already you are spending significant time now clarifying technical queries & making documents for the current projects. Allot some time in the upcoming quarters to reflect on future work and deepen your understanding of features to enhance your leadership role. Broaden your knowledge beyond certain integrations to all the integrations a little deeper for a more significant contribution."
